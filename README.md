# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-Diagnostic-Data-Set-ML-Model
The dataset contains all reading of the female patients from Wiscosin a state in US who were diagnosed with Breast Cancer. The data set contains large volume of test results and readings. The diagnosis is further catagorieses based on nature of cancer, namely **Malignant** *(the presence of cancerous cells that have the ability to spread to other sites in the body (metastasize) or to invade nearby (locally) and destroy tissues. Malignant cells tend to have fast, uncontrolled growth)* and **Benign** *(Benign tumors are those that stay in their primary location without invading other sites of the body. They do not spread to local structures or to distant parts of the body. Benign tumors tend to grow slowly and have distinct borders.)*  

Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis on data of Breast Cancers in women. In EDA we manipulate data as per our need and find different patterns using ratios and relations between features which will help the ML model to diagnose Breast Cancer with its type.
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to assist in diagnosing breast cancer using clinical features. We start with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the patterns in the data, identify key feature relationships, and handle data quality issues such as outliers and missing values. The goal is to select meaningful features and reduce noise to improve model performance and ensure accurate diagnosis predictions. Key steps include outlier treatment using the Box-Cox transformation, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and UMAP.
